What is Programming?
 > Programming is the process of creating a set of instruction that tells a computer about the task, how to perform it and delivered the 
  a specific output.
 > Programming is a task to implement a solution to a problem in the form of computer language.
 > Programming is the process that models or structure the set of instructions that instruct the machine how to perform a task and what
   to perform.

Data Structure and Algorithm : A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, 
                               An Algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
                               Data structure and algorithm are the foundational blocks of big building named as programming.

Binary Language: The language in the form of 0s and 1s, through which we can communicate with machines or computers is called binary language.
                 Computera understands only binary language, i.e., in the form of 0s and 1s(Zero's and One's). It is also known as 
                 "machine level language" or "low level language".
